# In Progress

A vibe-coded Gemini Daily Planner hosted here - [https://gemini-daily-planner-112027365507.us-west1.run.app/](https://gemini-daily-planner-112027365507.us-west1.run.app/)

This is a daily planner app I am in the process of building using code assistance from Google's AI Studio and Gemini CLI. 

Currently connects to your Gmail and identifies a list of tasks. Then takes you to a schedule builder page.

Next steps:
- connect to Google Calendar
- connect properly to Google Tasks
- connect travel times (may require database and not just frontend)
- properly populate tasks
